How Versioning works in Node ?
 - There are there part in version (eg. 4.19.2)
  - Third part -> 2 (Minor Changes)
  - second part -> 19 (Recommended Changes) [should update]
  - First part -> 4 (Major Changes)

  - Caret Symbol (^) means it will update the package every time the new update comes in third and second part only to [^4.19.2]

  - Approximate Symbol (~) means it will update the package every time the update comes in recommended part (second part) only.

  - (latest) Uses the latest version {risky}.
